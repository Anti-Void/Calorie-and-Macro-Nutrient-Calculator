#Calorie and Macro Nutrient Calculator V 0.8
#Created by Anti-Void
#Last Update: May 3rd 2024 @ 9:08 PM

#Features to add: Female support,
#                 calculate average calories based upon calories burned last 7 days
#                 add the option to save multiple data blocks in one text file
#                 add other 3 fitness goals

#Features added: 05/06/24 9:29 PM
                #-more accurate computer generated data
